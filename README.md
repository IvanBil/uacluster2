# UACluster2
## Project Description
UACluster2 is set of manuals and tools to create and manage high performance computing cluster based on Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machines. It needs Microsoft HPC Server 2008 (Microsoft HPC Server 2008 R2) as a basis of cluster creation. 

The project is next generation of [UACluster](http://uacluster.codeplex.com/) project.

## The aim of the project
The aim of the project is providing users with essential documentation and tools for fast and easy creation of HPC cluster with following features:
 - Algorithmically universal computing system
 - Easy and fast system deployment
 - Ability to use PCs for computing tasks and users working simultaneously
 - Easy and fast computing system reconfiguration without making any changes to hardware configurations
   - "Hot" computing system reconfiguration
   - Tools for creation of optimized computing system configurations for certain task requirements (e. g. OpenMP tasks or MPI tasks)
 - Optimization of hardware resources utilization
 - Prospects for creating new configurations as a result of virtualization platform improvements in future
 ## Components
 - Tools
   - PowerShell script for fast Virtual Machine HPC nodes creation and deployment
   - VMClusterManager Utility for management of the cluster
   - Web site of the cluster containing Web interface which allows users submit tasks to the cluster and view various reporting information
 - Manuals
   - HPC cluster deployment guide
   - VMClusterManager utility user guide
   - Deployment guide for the Web site
